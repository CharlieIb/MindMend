############### Querying association between Conditions and Resources/Therapeutic Recommendations ##########
### Way1: examining all data and their connected conditions
for condition in conditions:
    if condition:
            therapeutic_recs = condition.therapeutic_recs
            resources = condition.resources
            for rec in therapeutic_recs:
                    print(f"Condition: {condition.name}, Rec ID: {rec.rec_id}, Description: {rec.description}, Source: {rec.source}")
            for res in resources:
                    print(f"Condition: {condition.name}, Res ID: {res.resource_id}, Label: {res.label}, Link: {res.link}")
    else:
            print("Condition not found")

### Way 2: examining the association tables data
# Query all therapeutic_rec_condition associations
associations = db.session.execute(sa.select(therapeutic_rec_condition)).fetchall()
for association in associations:
    print(f"Therapeutic ID: {association.therapeutic_id}, Condition ID: {association.condition_id}")

# Query all resource_condition associations
associations = db.session.execute(sa.select(resource_condition)).fetchall()
for association in associations:
    print(f"Resource ID: {association.resource_id}, Condition ID: {association.condition_id}")


### Way 3: testing joins work
import sqlalchemy.orm as so
# Query conditions and their therapeutic recommendations (make sure to import orm as so)
conditions_with_recs = (
    db.session.query(Condition)
    .options(so.joinedload(Condition.therapeutic_recs))
    .all()
)

# Print the results
for condition in conditions_with_recs:
    print(f"Condition: {condition.name}")
    for rec in condition.therapeutic_recs:
        print(f"  - Therapeutic Recommendation: {rec.description}")
    print()  # Add a blank line for readability


# Query conditions and their resources (make sure to import orm as so)
conditions_with_resources = (
    db.session.query(Condition)
    .options(so.joinedload(Condition.resources))
    .all()
)

# Print the results
for condition in conditions_with_resources:
    print(f"Condition: {condition.name}")
    for resource in condition.resources:
        print(f"  - Resource: {resource.label} ({resource.link})")
    print()  # Add a blank line for readability
